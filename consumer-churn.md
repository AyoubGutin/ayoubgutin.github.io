# Customer Churn Analysis and Predictions

---


## Executive Summary
This project focuses on providing a high-level visualisations of consumer churn at a fictional company, Telco, and train a machine learning model (Logstic Regression) to provide a GUI for predicting churn.
The main objective is to identify which customers are likely to leave based on relevant features. The results were then validated using metrics, like **ROC Curve** and **Confusion Matrix**.
A PowerBI dashboard was then created to provide a high level overview of consumer churn using visualisations. 

1. Clean Data
2. Peform EDA
3. Make a PowerBI Dashboard
4. Train a machine learning model to implement a GUI for predicting a consumer's propensity to churn

### Machine Learning ROC Curve 

The following **ROC Curve** evaluates the performance of the logisitc regression model in differentiating churners and non-churners. A higher **AUC** (Area Under the Curve) indicates better performance and reliability.

### Dashboard

Below is a screenshot of the **PowerBI Dashboard** used for provoding a high level overview of consumer churn using visualisations
