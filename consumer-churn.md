## Executive Summary
This project focuses on providing a high-level visualisations of consumer churn at a fictional company, Telco, and train a machine learning model (Logstic Regression).
The main objective is to identify which customers are likely to leave based on relevant features. The results were then validated using metrics, like **ROC Curve** and **Confusion Matrix**.
A PowerBI dashboard was then created to provide a high level overview of consumer churn using visualisations.

### Machine Learning ROC Curve 

The following **ROC Curve** evaluates the performance of the logisitc regression model in differentiating churners and non-churners. A higher **AUC** (Area Under the Curve) indicates better performance and reliability.
